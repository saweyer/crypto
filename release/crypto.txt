Crypto supports solving cryptogram, code, cipher
(single character substitution) puzzles, like those in newspapers

Crypto is a shareware, 2.x-only Newton application: it works best on
MesssagePad 2000 (MP2K) or eMate, but it can also be used with short puzzles
on smaller screens (MP130 or MP120).
